  <h1>Fixed vs Tracker Mortgages (UK) – How to Choose</h1>
  <p class="meta">Published: <time datetime="2026-02-08">8 Feb 2026</time></p>

  <p>
    In the UK, many borrowers choose between a <strong>fixed-rate mortgage</strong> (often for 2 or 5 years) and a
    <strong>tracker mortgage</strong> (which typically moves with the Bank of England Base Rate, plus a margin).
    There isn’t one “best” choice—only what fits your priorities: certainty, flexibility, or lowest expected cost.
  </p>

  <h2>Fixed-rate mortgages</h2>
  <p>
    Your interest rate is fixed for an initial period (e.g., 2/3/5/10 years). Your monthly payment is usually stable
    during that period.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Why fixes are popular:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Predictable payments (better for budgeting)</li>
    <li>Protection if rates rise</li>
    <li>Peace of mind for families and first-time buyers</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Early Repayment Charges (ERCs):</strong> leaving the deal early can be expensive.</li>
    <li><strong>Porting:</strong> if you move home, you may be able to port the mortgage, subject to lender approval.</li>
    <li><strong>Overpayment limits:</strong> many fixed deals allow ~10% overpayments per year without ERCs (varies by lender).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tracker mortgages</h2>
  <p>
    A tracker typically follows the <strong>Bank of England Base Rate</strong> plus a set margin (e.g., “Base Rate + 0.75%”).
    If base rate rises, payments usually rise; if it falls, payments can fall.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Can be cheaper if rates fall</li>
    <li>Often more flexible than fixed rates (not always)</li>
    <li>Transparent link to base rate</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payments can rise quickly and unpredictably</li>
    <li>Harder to plan long-term budgets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A simple decision framework</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>If you need payment certainty:</strong> a fixed rate is often safer.</li>
    <li><strong>If flexibility matters most:</strong> a tracker (or low/no-ERC product) may suit you.</li>
    <li><strong>If you may move soon:</strong> check ERCs and whether the product is portable.</li>
    <li><strong>If you plan to overpay:</strong> check overpayment allowances and ERC structure.</li>
  </ul>
