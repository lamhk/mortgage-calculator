  <h1>First-Time Buyer Mortgage (UK) – A Simple Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
  <p class="meta">Published: <time datetime="2026-02-08">8 Feb 2026</time></p>
  <p class="meta">UK terminology: AIP/DIP, conveyancing, SDLT, RICS surveys, exchange &amp; completion.</p>

  <p>
    Buying your first home in the UK can feel complicated because there are several moving parts: your deposit,
    your credit profile, lender affordability checks, and the conveyancing (legal) process. The good news is that most
    first-time buyer journeys follow the same steps. Once you know the order, it becomes much easier to plan.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Work out your realistic budget (not just the maximum)</h2>
  <p>Start with three numbers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Deposit:</strong> how much you can put down (including any gifted deposit).</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly payment comfort zone:</strong> what you can afford without stretching your lifestyle.</li>
    <li><strong>Upfront buying costs:</strong> solicitor/conveyancing fees, searches, surveys, and SDLT (if applicable).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Many lenders will lend up to around 4–4.5x income (not a rule, and affordability varies), but your personal comfort
    level matters just as much—especially with energy bills and general cost-of-living changes.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: Check your credit file early (UK-specific)</h2>
  <p>Before you apply, check your credit reports and tidy up common issues:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure you’re on the <strong>electoral roll</strong> at your current address.</li>
    <li>Check your address history is consistent across accounts.</li>
    <li>Avoid taking new credit (car finance, new credit cards) right before applying.</li>
    <li>Pay all commitments on time (even one missed payment can hurt).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Gather your documents</h2>
  <p>Lenders and brokers commonly ask for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Photo ID + proof of address</li>
    <li>Recent payslips and P60 (or contracts if you’re a contractor)</li>
    <li>Bank statements (usually 3 months; sometimes more)</li>
    <li>Evidence of deposit and source of funds (including gifted deposit documents if relevant)</li>
    <li>If self-employed: SA302s + Tax Year Overviews (and/or accounts), typically 2+ years</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 4: Get an Agreement in Principle (AIP) / Decision in Principle (DIP)</h2>
  <p>
    An AIP/DIP is a lender’s initial indication of what you may be able to borrow. It’s not a full offer, but it helps you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>House-hunt with confidence and a clearer budget</li>
    <li>Strengthen your position when making an offer</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 5: Make an offer and start the full mortgage application</h2>
  <p>
    Once your offer is accepted, you’ll proceed with the full application. This is where the lender verifies your
    income, spending patterns, deposit source, and other details.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 6: Valuation, underwriting, and surveys</h2>
  <p>
    The lender will do a <strong>mortgage valuation</strong> to confirm the property value for lending purposes.
    This is not the same as a <strong>home survey</strong> (which is for your peace of mind). Many buyers choose:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>RICS Home Survey Level 2</strong> (common for typical properties)</li>
    <li><strong>RICS Home Survey Level 3</strong> (older homes, unusual construction, or if you want deeper detail)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If the valuation comes back lower than the agreed price (a “down valuation”), you may need to renegotiate, increase
    your deposit, or reconsider the purchase.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 7: Mortgage offer, exchange, completion</h2>
  <p>When the lender is satisfied, they issue a formal <strong>mortgage offer</strong>. Then:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Exchange of contracts:</strong> key commitment point; you’ll usually pay your exchange deposit (often 10%).</li>
    <li><strong>Completion:</strong> funds are transferred and you get the keys.</li>
  </ul>

    <strong>UK tip:</strong> Avoid major financial changes between application and completion (new credit, big transfers, job changes)
    unless you’ve checked with your broker/lender first.

    <strong>Call to action:</strong>
    Share your approximate income, deposit, and whether you’re employed or self-employed, and I can suggest a sensible next-step checklist.
