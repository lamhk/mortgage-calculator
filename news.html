    <h2 style="margin:6px 0 8px; font-size:1.25rem;">Bank Rate held at <strong>3.75%</strong></h2>
    <p class="meta">Decision date: <time datetime="2026-02-05">5 Feb 2026</time> · Next due: <time datetime="2026-03-19">19 Mar 2026</time></p>

    <p class="k" style="margin:0 0 8px;">
      Summary (from the BoE): rates were held after a series of cuts since Aug 2024; inflation has fallen significantly from its peak and is expected to return to the 2% target in spring. The MPC noted there may be scope for further cuts this year if the outlook evolves as expected.

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 8px; font-size:1.25rem;">Market commentary (what it can mean for borrowers)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tracker mortgages:</strong> usually move broadly with Bank Rate. A “hold” typically means tracker payments are <strong>unlikely to change immediately</strong> (unless your lender changes margins/fees).</li>
      <li><strong>Fixed-rate mortgages:</strong> are driven more by market expectations (swap rates) than today’s decision alone. If markets expect further cuts, fixed rates can ease <strong>before</strong> the Bank actually cuts.</li>
      <li><strong>Remortgaging timing:</strong> if your deal ends soon, it’s worth comparing a product transfer vs switching lender, and checking any fees/early repayment charges. Small rate differences can be offset by fees.</li>
      <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> lenders still assess affordability with buffers. Even if rates trend down, approval depends on income, commitments, and credit history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="margin:14px 0 8px; font-size:1.05rem;">What to watch next</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Upcoming MPC decision: <strong>19 March 2026</strong></li>
      <li>Inflation and wage/labour-market data (these influence the path of future cuts/holds)</li>
      <li>Average quoted fixed rates from major lenders (what consumers actually pay)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      If you want, tell me your scenario (first-time buyer vs remortgage, fixed vs tracker, when your current deal ends) and I can suggest what numbers to compare (rate, fee, ERC, total cost) — without giving personalised financial advice.
