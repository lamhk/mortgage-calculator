    <h2>Article 1: First-Time Buyer Mortgage (UK) – A Simple Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

    <p>
      Buying your first home in the UK can feel complicated because there are several moving parts: your deposit,
      your credit profile, lender affordability checks, and the conveyancing (legal) process. The good news is that most
      first-time buyer journeys follow the same steps. Once you know the order, it becomes much easier to plan.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Work out your realistic budget (not just the maximum)</h3>
    <p>Start with three numbers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deposit:</strong> how much you can put down (including any gifted deposit).</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly payment comfort zone:</strong> what you can afford without stretching your lifestyle.</li>
      <li><strong>Upfront buying costs:</strong> solicitor/conveyancing fees, searches, surveys, and SDLT (if applicable).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Many lenders will lend up to around 4–4.5x income (not a rule, and affordability varies), but your personal comfort
      level matters just as much—especially with energy bills and general cost-of-living changes.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Check your credit file early (UK-specific)</h3>
    <p>Before you apply, check your credit reports and tidy up common issues:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure you’re on the <strong>electoral roll</strong> at your current address.</li>
      <li>Check your address history is consistent across accounts.</li>
      <li>Avoid taking new credit (car finance, new credit cards) right before applying.</li>
      <li>Pay all commitments on time (even one missed payment can hurt).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Gather your documents</h3>
    <p>Lenders and brokers commonly ask for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Photo ID + proof of address</li>
      <li>Recent payslips and P60 (or contracts if you’re a contractor)</li>
      <li>Bank statements (usually 3 months; sometimes more)</li>
      <li>Evidence of deposit and source of funds (including gifted deposit documents if relevant)</li>
      <li>If self-employed: SA302s + Tax Year Overviews (and/or accounts), typically 2+ years</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 4: Get an Agreement in Principle (AIP) / Decision in Principle (DIP)</h3>
    <p>
      An AIP/DIP is a lender’s initial indication of what you may be able to borrow. It’s not a full offer, but it helps you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>House-hunt with confidence and a clearer budget</li>
      <li>Strengthen your position when making an offer</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 5: Make an offer and start the full mortgage application</h3>
    <p>
      Once your offer is accepted, you’ll proceed with the full application. This is where the lender verifies your
      income, spending patterns, deposit source, and other details.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 6: Valuation, underwriting, and surveys</h3>
    <p>
      The lender will do a <strong>mortgage valuation</strong> to confirm the property value for lending purposes.
      This is not the same as a <strong>home survey</strong> (which is for your peace of mind). Many buyers choose:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>RICS Home Survey Level 2</strong> (common for typical properties)</li>
      <li><strong>RICS Home Survey Level 3</strong> (older homes, unusual construction, or if you want deeper detail)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the valuation comes back lower than the agreed price (a “down valuation”), you may need to renegotiate, increase
      your deposit, or reconsider the purchase.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 7: Mortgage offer, exchange, completion</h3>
    <p>When the lender is satisfied, they issue a formal <strong>mortgage offer</strong>. Then:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Exchange of contracts:</strong> key commitment point; you’ll usually pay your exchange deposit (often 10%).</li>
      <li><strong>Completion:</strong> funds are transferred and you get the keys.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>UK tip:</strong> Avoid major financial changes between application and completion (new credit, big transfers, job changes)
      unless you’ve checked with your broker/lender first.

    <h2>Article 2: Fixed vs Tracker Mortgages (UK) – How to Choose</h2>

    <p>
      In the UK, many borrowers choose between a <strong>fixed-rate mortgage</strong> (often for 2 or 5 years) and a
      <strong>tracker mortgage</strong> (which typically moves with the Bank of England Base Rate, plus a margin).
      There isn’t one “best” choice—only what fits your priorities: certainty, flexibility, or lowest expected cost.
    </p>

    <h3>Fixed-rate mortgages</h3>
    <p>
      Your interest rate is fixed for an initial period (e.g., 2/3/5/10 years). Your monthly payment is usually stable
      during that period.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Why fixes are popular:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Predictable payments (better for budgeting)</li>
      <li>Protection if rates rise</li>
      <li>Peace of mind for families and first-time buyers</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Early Repayment Charges (ERCs):</strong> leaving the deal early can be expensive.</li>
      <li><strong>Porting:</strong> if you move home, you may be able to port the mortgage, subject to lender approval.</li>
      <li><strong>Overpayment limits:</strong> many fixed deals allow ~10% overpayments per year without ERCs (varies by lender).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tracker mortgages</h3>
    <p>
      A tracker typically follows the <strong>Bank of England Base Rate</strong> plus a set margin (e.g., “Base Rate + 0.75%”).
      If base rate rises, payments usually rise; if it falls, payments can fall.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can be cheaper if rates fall</li>
      <li>Often more flexible than fixed rates (not always)</li>
      <li>Transparent link to base rate</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payments can rise quickly and unpredictably</li>
      <li>Harder to plan long-term budgets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A simple decision framework</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If you need payment certainty:</strong> a fixed rate is often safer.</li>
      <li><strong>If flexibility matters most:</strong> a tracker (or low/no-ERC product) may suit you.</li>
      <li><strong>If you may move soon:</strong> check ERCs and whether the product is portable.</li>
      <li><strong>If you plan to overpay:</strong> check overpayment allowances and ERC structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 3: The Real Cost of Buying a Home in the UK – Fees, SDLT, and “Hidden” Costs</h2>

    <p>
      Many UK buyers focus on the deposit and monthly mortgage payment, but the extra costs can add up.
      Planning for them early helps you avoid last-minute surprises and reduces stress during conveyancing.
    </p>

    <h3>1) Upfront buying costs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Solicitor / conveyancing fees</strong> (plus VAT where applicable)</li>
      <li><strong>Searches</strong> (local authority, drainage, environmental, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Mortgage valuation fee</strong> (sometimes included, sometimes separate)</li>
      <li><strong>Survey costs</strong> (RICS Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the property)</li>
      <li><strong>Broker fee</strong> (if your broker charges; many are free-to-client)</li>
      <li><strong>Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)</strong> in England/Northern Ireland (different taxes apply in Scotland/Wales)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> Property taxes differ across the UK (SDLT in England/N.I., LBTT in Scotland, LTT in Wales),
      and rates/reliefs change. Always confirm the latest thresholds for first-time buyers and additional properties.
    </div>

    <h3>2) Mortgage product fees</h3>
    <p>Even if the interest rate looks attractive, check:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Product/arrangement fee</strong> (sometimes £0, sometimes £999+)</li>
      <li><strong>Booking/reservation fee</strong> (often non-refundable)</li>
      <li><strong>ERCs</strong> during the initial period</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A “lower rate + higher fee” deal isn’t always cheaper overall—especially if you’re borrowing a smaller amount or
      expect to remortgage soon.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Moving and setup costs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Removal company / van hire</li>
      <li>Furniture and appliances</li>
      <li>Replacing locks</li>
      <li>Immediate repairs and decorating</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4) Ongoing homeowner costs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buildings insurance</strong> (often required by the lender from exchange/completion)</li>
      <li><strong>Contents insurance</strong> (optional but sensible)</li>
      <li><strong>Council Tax</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Utilities</strong> and broadband</li>
      <li><strong>Service charge/ground rent</strong> (leasehold or managed freehold)</li>
      <li><strong>Maintenance fund</strong> (boiler, roof, plumbing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5) Avoiding “payment shock” when your deal ends</h3>
    <p>
      If you choose a shorter fix (e.g., 2 years), your payment could change when the deal ends. It’s smart to stress-test:
      could you cope if your payment increased materially when you remortgage?
